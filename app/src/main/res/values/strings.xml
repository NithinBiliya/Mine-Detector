    <string name="about_text">
        This game is inspired by the classic MineSweeper game. \n
        The game UI consists of a number of squares and each square may or may not contain a mine. \n
        Each time you dig (When you select a square â€“ when
you do a touch), you find a number. That number will tell you exactly how many mines
are adjacent to your square (e.g. a 2 means that exactly 2 of the 8 squares that
surround your square are mines and that the other 6 squares are safe to click on). \n
		Dig up all the safe squares to win the game. You lose when you dig out a mine. \n
